# Smart-Irrigation-System
An IoT-based system that automates plant irrigation using a Raspberry Pi, DHT11 (temperature and humidity) sensor, and a soil moisture sensor.  The system monitors real-time data and uploads it to ThingSpeak Cloud, where MATLAB analytics decide whether the plant needs watering and send alerts accordingly.
